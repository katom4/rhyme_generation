The code is written in Python and follows a basic object-oriented approach with a class `Word_Info` encapsulating the word processing logic. 

- **Naming**: Class names are in `CamelCase` (e.g., `Word_Info`) and method names are in `snake_case` (e.g., `get_vowels`).
- **Docstrings and Type Hints**: The code currently lacks docstrings and type hints.
- **Testing**: There is no formal testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` in use. Testing is done via a manual script `test.py`.
